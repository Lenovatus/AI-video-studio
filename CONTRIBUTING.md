# Contributing to AI-video-studio

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project follows a few simple guidelines to make collaborating easy and friendly.

Getting started
- Fork the repository and create a branch for your work: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
- Keep your branch focused: one feature / bugfix per branch.
- Rebase or merge in upstream main frequently to avoid large conflicts.

Reporting issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use the issue templates (bug or feature) to provide reproducible steps, expected behavior, and environment details.

Development
- If the repo includes a package manager (package.json, pyproject.toml), run the tests locally before opening a PR.
- Add tests for bugfixes and new features when feasible.

Commit messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Prefer Conventional Commits format (e.g. feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:) for changelog automation.

Pull requests
- Link to the issue your PR addresses (if any).
- Provide a short description of the change and any setup required to test it.
- Keep PRs small and focused.

Code style and tests
- Follow the existing code style.
- Include or update tests for any new behavior.
